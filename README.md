# Classical ML Algorithms 
We studied several classical ML algorithms for classification between Star-Galaxy and Star-Galaxy-Quasar.

# MargNet
Unofficial PyTorch implementation of the paper, **[Photometric identification of compact galaxies, stars and quasars using multiple neural networks](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/518/2/3123/6831636?login=false&utm_source=authortollfreelinkguestAccessKey=10ada097-d979-4037-84af-c72d47f5c21b)**.

The official implementation in tensorflow can be found at https://github.com/sidchaini/MargNet/tree/main

# MargFormer
This part of the work (studied as MM ViT) was published in the Journal of **[Astrophysics and Space Science](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10509-024-04357-9)**. The arxiv pre-print is **[here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13634)**.
